## üßêAbout me 

<!--Hi, I am Vikrant Kumar Tufani and I‚Äôm a CSE graduate from the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun. I am mainly skilled in java, springboot, MySQL, React and javascript. I'm passionate about contributing to the developer community and like to explore open source sometimes. In my freetime, I watch content on new topics, listen to music, read blogs and stay updated about world affairs. My goal is to remain focused on what I do and be good at it. -->  

I am a dynamic individual with a passion for technology and a knack for creativity. Holding a Bachelor of Technology degree from the esteemed University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, I have immersed myself in the world of Information Technology for the past 2.5 years, honing my skills and expertise on various tools and technologies.

My professional journey has equipped me with a diverse skill set encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Git, C++, and Data Structures & Algorithms. This proficiency enables me to navigate through various sectors of IT with adaptability and precision, whether it is developing seamless user interfaces or delving deep into the process of software development.

Not only limited to coding, I take interest in graphic design as well. Exploring the intersection of aesthetics and functionality, I indulge my creative impulses to breathe life into digital canvases, transforming concepts into visually captivating experiences.

Outside of the digital domain, I am an avid sports enthusiast. Football, athletics, and gym workouts are not merely pastimes but integral components of my lifestyle, fostering discipline, perseverance, and a healthy competitive spirit.

With a immense dedication to continuous learning and a zeal for innovation, I am ready to embark on new challenges and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
